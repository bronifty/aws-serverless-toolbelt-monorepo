# PNPM monorepo with Nx; may look at swapping nx out with vanilla node 22 cache and monorepo support; but i also want to use nx for zach's project which incorporates it, so there's that. anyway, maybe why not both situation

---

##### Nx Usage Notes

- whereas with pnpm you filter the command for the project, with nx you run the command and specify the project

```sh
 npx nx <target> <project>
```

target is the NPM script in this specific case you want to execute.

### Sample Nx Commands

- dev is the package.json script in the web project

```sh
npx nx dev web
npx nx test @bronifty/marcs-observable
```

- run commands in parallel

```sh
npx nx run-many --target=build --all
npx nx run-many --target=build --projects=@bronifty/marcs-observable,web
```

> Note Iâ€™m prefixing the commands with npx which runs the Nx executable in the node_modules folder. In this way I don't have to install nx globally. If you prefer doing that, feel free to do so.
